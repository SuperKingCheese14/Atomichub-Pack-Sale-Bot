# Atomichub-Pack-Sale-Bot
A bot written in Python that buys pack drops from Atomichub.
I wrote this script as part of a tutorial on my website: https://waxfreak.wordpress.com/2023/01/30/atomichub-bots/ More information can be found there.
You will need to paste your private key in to the script in order to sign the transactions.
The bot will ask the user for their wallet address, the amount of packs they wish to purchase and the amount of WAXP tokens to deposit to the atomicassetsx contract. After the user inputs the bot will automatically purchase the specified drop from Atomichub.
